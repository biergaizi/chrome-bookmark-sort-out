What can it do?
---------------

I used bookmarks a long time. If I saw something useful web page, I will put it into my bookmark. But sort out the bookmarks is really hard work. Now I have more than a thousand of bookmarks, sort out them manually is impossible.

This program can check the name of the bookmark by your regular expressions, and put them into right folder automatically.
